PHP Application Form - README

Overview

This project contains a PHP-based application form. The code is designed to run on a local server and can be viewed in a web browser. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP (version 7.4 or higher)

Verify installation by running:

php -v

If PHP is not installed, download it from php.net.

Web Browser

Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

VSCode (Optional)

Install the following extensions for better PHP development:

PHP Intelephense

PHP Server

Steps to Run the Application

1. Clone or Download the Project

Save the php_application_form.php file in a dedicated folder on your computer.

2. Start a Local PHP Server

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing the PHP file:

cd /path/to/your/php/file

Start the PHP built-in server:

php -S localhost:8000

The server will start, and you can access the application at:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

3. Open the Application in a Browser

Open your web browser and visit the URL:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

Optional: Using PHP Server Extension in VSCode

If you prefer running the project directly in VSCode:

Install the PHP Server extension.

Open php_application_form.php in VSCode.

Right-click anywhere in the file and select "PHP Server: Serve Project".

A URL will appear in the terminal. Open it in your browser to view the application.

Notes

Since the application interacts with a database, ensure:

The database server (e.g., MySQL) is installed and running.

The database is configured correctly in the PHP code.

For troubleshooting, check the terminal or browser console for errors.

Subject: Clarification on In-Sprint Automation Timeline
 
Hi [Manager's Name],
 
I wanted to inform you that I am currently engaged in regression automation work, which is why I haven't been able to focus on in-sprint automation so far.
 
If I begin working on the in-sprint stories from Monday, 4th August, I will have approximately one week to cover the following:
 
Story 6850, 6851: Test case creation and testing are already completed; I just need to work on automation.
 
Story 7630, 7633: Both test case creation and testing are pending and need to be completed within this time frame.
 
 
Considering the tight schedule, I believe automation may not be feasible for these stories within the given timeline. However, manual testing is possible and can be completed within the sprint.
 
Please let me know your thoughts and if you would prefer I proceed with manual testing or suggest an alternative approach.
Also, for automation, I will require one full sprint.
 
Best regards,
Gauri
