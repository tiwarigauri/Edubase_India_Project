Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP (version 7.4 or higher)

Verify installation by running:

php -v

If PHP is not installed, download it from php.net.

Web Browser

Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

VSCode (Optional)

PHP Intelephense

PHP Server

Steps to Run the Application

1. Clone or Download the Project

Save the php_application_form.php file in a dedicated folder on your computer.

2. Start a Local PHP Server

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing the PHP file:

cd /path/to/your/php/file

Start the PHP built-in server:

php -S localhost:8000

The server will start, and you can access the application at:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

3. Open the Application in a Browser

Open your web browser and visit the URL:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

Optional: Using PHP Server Extension in VSCode

If you prefer running the project directly in VSCode:

Install the PHP Server extension.

Open php_application_form.php in VSCode.

Right-click anywhere in the file and select "PHP Server: Serve Project".

A URL will appear in the terminal. Open it in your browser to view the application.

Notes

Since the application interacts with a database, ensure:

The database server (e.g., MySQL) is installed and running.

The database is configured correctly in the PHP code.

For troubleshooting, check the terminal or browser console for errors.
