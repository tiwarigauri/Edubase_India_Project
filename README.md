PHP Application Form - README

Overview

This project contains a PHP-based application form. The code is designed to run on a local server and can be viewed in a web browser. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP (version 7.4 or higher)

Verify installation by running:

php -v

If PHP is not installed, download it from php.net.

Web Browser

Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

VSCode (Optional)

Install the following extensions for better PHP development:

PHP Intelephense

PHP Server

Steps to Run the Application

1. Clone or Download the Project

Save the php_application_form.php file in a dedicated folder on your computer.

2. Start a Local PHP Server

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing the PHP file:

cd /path/to/your/php/file

Start the PHP built-in server:

php -S localhost:8000

The server will start, and you can access the application at:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

3. Open the Application in a Browser

Open your web browser and visit the URL:

http://localhost:8000/php_application_form.php

Optional: Using PHP Server Extension in VSCode

If you prefer running the project directly in VSCode:

Install the PHP Server extension.

Open php_application_form.php in VSCode.

Right-click anywhere in the file and select "PHP Server: Serve Project".

A URL will appear in the terminal. Open it in your browser to view the application.

Notes

Since the application interacts with a database, ensure:

The database server (e.g., MySQL) is installed and running.

The database is configured correctly in the PHP code.

For troubleshooting, check the terminal or browser console for errors.

Subject: Closure Confirmation for SCIG-7952
 
Hi [Recipient's Name],
 
As discussed in our last call, we are good to proceed with the closure of SCIG-7952.
 
The Moody’s team has confirmed that the current screen displayed when the user tampers with the BVD ID — whether by modifying/adding characters to the actual ID or replacing it entirely with a random value like “1234” — is expected and correct behavior. This is consistent across all the mentioned scenarios.
 
Please let me know if you need any further details.
 
Best regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Clarification on Error Pages and Orbis Defects Update

Hi Orbis Team,

Thank you for confirming that Orbis is different from S360 in terms of the setup.

I have a few queries regarding the user experience: In the scenarios mentioned below, what error pages will be displayed to the users? Will they be the same as S360 or different?

Here are the four dummy scenarios for your reference:

[Scenario 1 description]

[Scenario 2 description]

[Scenario 3 description]

[Scenario 4 description]

Additionally, please find below the FTP link where I have shared the document containing all the relevant details for the two new Orbis defects identified during testing. Could you please review and let me know when we can expect the fixes?

Also, regarding S360, could you please provide an update on when we can expect the remaining two fixes related to User ID inconsistency and the Signout feature not working properly?
